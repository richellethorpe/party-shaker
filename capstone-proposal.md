##Name of Project:Party Shaker

##Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Party Shaker will use the NoSQL cloud-hosted database Firestore for user authentication and holding user data and saved recipes that they've created or liked. Users have the ability to create accounts and update saved information. The application will take user input for a single cocktail and returns a large batch recipe based upon how many total cocktails need to be made and how many bottles need to be purchased. 

##If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here:

- animated logo on splash page
- additional questions about the cocktail prior to mulitplying it (stirred or shaken? ) that will dictate additional steps in batching. And additional information will be provided to the batching instructions based on those questions. 
- information about cost savings. (still flushing out this idea.)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- React
- Firebase 
- JavaScript / JSX
- HTML / CSS
- Webpack

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Still very much workshoping this concept and once I've got more information about React I should be able to better articulate what will be utilized and what functionality will be doable.
